## Calls

---------
### abdicate_membership
Allows the calling member to *unilaterally quit* without this being subject to a GC
vote.

\# Arguments
* `origin` - Member of committee who wants to quit.

\# Error

* Only primary key can abdicate.
* Last member of a group cannot abdicate.
#### Attributes
No attributes

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'CddServiceProviders', 'abdicate_membership', {}
)
```

---------
### add_member
Adds a member `who` to the group. May only be called from `AddOrigin` or root.

\# Arguments
* `origin` - Origin representing `AddOrigin` or root
* `who` - IdentityId to be added to the group.
#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| who | `IdentityId` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'CddServiceProviders', 'add_member', {'who': '[u8; 32]'}
)
```

---------
### disable_member
Disables a member at specific moment.

Please note that if member is already revoked (a &quot;valid member&quot;), its revocation
time-stamp will be updated.

Any disabled member should NOT allow to act like an active member of the group. For
instance, a disabled CDD member should NOT be able to generate a CDD claim. However any
generated claim issued before `at` would be considered as a valid one.

If you want to invalidate any generated claim, you should use `Self::remove_member`.

\# Arguments
* `at` - Revocation time-stamp.
* `who` - Target member of the group.
* `expiry` - Time-stamp when `who` is removed from CDD. As soon as it is expired, the
generated claims will be &quot;invalid&quot; as `who` is not considered a member of the group.
#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| who | `IdentityId` | 
| expiry | `Option<T::Moment>` | 
| at | `Option<T::Moment>` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'CddServiceProviders', 'disable_member', {
    'at': (None, 'u64'),
    'expiry': (None, 'u64'),
    'who': '[u8; 32]',
}
)
```

---------
### remove_member
Removes a member `who` from the set. May only be called from `RemoveOrigin` or root.

Any claim previously generated by this member is not valid as a group claim. For
instance, if a CDD member group generated a claim for a target identity and then it is
removed, that claim will be invalid.  In case you want to keep the validity of generated
claims, you have to use `Self::disable_member` function

\# Arguments
* `origin` - Origin representing `RemoveOrigin` or root
* `who` - IdentityId to be removed from the group.
#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| who | `IdentityId` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'CddServiceProviders', 'remove_member', {'who': '[u8; 32]'}
)
```

---------
### reset_members
Changes the membership to a new set, disregarding the existing membership.
May only be called from `ResetOrigin` or root.

\# Arguments
* `origin` - Origin representing `ResetOrigin` or root
* `members` - New set of identities
#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| members | `Vec<IdentityId>` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'CddServiceProviders', 'reset_members', {'members': ['[u8; 32]']}
)
```

---------
### set_active_members_limit
Change this group&\#x27;s limit for how many concurrent active members they may be.

\# Arguments
* `limit` - the number of active members there may be concurrently.
#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| limit | `MemberCount` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'CddServiceProviders', 'set_active_members_limit', {'limit': 'u32'}
)
```

---------
### swap_member
Swaps out one member `remove` for another member `add`.

May only be called from `SwapOrigin` or root.

\# Arguments
* `origin` - Origin representing `SwapOrigin` or root
* `remove` - IdentityId to be removed from the group.
* `add` - IdentityId to be added in place of `remove`.
#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| remove | `IdentityId` | 
| add | `IdentityId` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'CddServiceProviders', 'swap_member', {
    'add': '[u8; 32]',
    'remove': '[u8; 32]',
}
)
```
