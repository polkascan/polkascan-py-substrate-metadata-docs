---------
## Calls

---------
### claim
Claim rewards accumulated for specific staking position.

Function calculates amount of rewards to pay for specified staking position based on
the amount of points position accumulated. Function also unlocks all the rewards locked
from `increase_stake` based on the amount of the points.

This action is penalized by removing all the points and returning allocated unpaid rewards
for redistribution.

Parameters:
- `position_id`: The identifier of the position to claim rewards for.

Emits `RewardsClaimed` event when successful.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| position_id | `T::PositionItemId` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'Staking', 'claim', {'position_id': 'u128'}
)
```

---------
### increase_stake
Extrinsic to increase staked amount of existing staking position by specified `amount`.

`increase_stake` increases staked amount of position specified by `postion_id` by the
`amount` specified by the user.
Staking position must exist and `origin` has to be the owner of the position.
Users can stake tokens which are not vested or already staked.
Position&\#x27;s params e.g points are updated to offset stake increase and rewards
accumulated until this point are paid and locked to the user.

Parameters:
- `position_id`: The identifier of the position which stake will be increased.
- `amount`: Amount of native asset to be added to staked amount. `amount` can&\#x27;t be vested or
already staked

Emits `StakeAdded` event when successful.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| position_id | `T::PositionItemId` | 
| amount | `Balance` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'Staking', 'increase_stake', {
    'amount': 'u128',
    'position_id': 'u128',
}
)
```

---------
### initialize_staking
Staking pallet initialization. This call will reserved `pot`&\#x27;s balance to prevent
account dusting and start collecting fees from trades as rewards.

`pot`â€™s account has to have a balance which will be reserved to prevent account dusting.

Emits `StakingInitialized` event when successful.

#### Attributes
No attributes

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'Staking', 'initialize_staking', {}
)
```

---------
### stake
Stake `amount` into a new staking position.

`stake` locks specified `amount` into staking and creates new NFT representing staking
position.
Users can stake `NativeAssetId` balance which is not vested or already staked.

Staking pallet must be initialized otherwise extrinsic will fail with error.

Parameters:
- `amount`: Amount of native asset to be staked. `amount` can&\#x27;t be vested or already
staked

Emits `PositionCreated` event when successful.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| amount | `Balance` | 

#### Python
```python
call = substrate.compose_call(
    'Staking', 'stake', {'amount': 'u128'}
)
```

---------
### unstake
Function pays rewards, unlocks all the staked assets and destroys staking position
specified by `position_id`.

Function calculates and pays latest rewards, unlocks all the locked rewards and staked
tokens for staking position and burns NFT representing staking position.
Unpaid allocated rewards are returned to the Staking for redistribution.

Parameters:
- `position_id`: The identifier of the position to be destroyed.

Emits `RewardsClaimed` and `Unstaked` events when successful.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type |
| -------- | -------- | 
| position_id | `T::PositionItemId` |
